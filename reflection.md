- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
    For both the library and house clases I decided to override the showOptions() method to include building-specific options, like `moveIn` or `removeTitle`. I overloaded a couple of things in both the house and cafe classes. I kind of thought it would be fun to have a `ringDoorbell` method so I added one, which allows there to be another option to enter the house. Also, I added different constructors that provide different parameters for intializing a `House` object. For the cafe class, I made it possible to order a coffee by including the size but not specifying whether they wanted sugar packets or creams if they didn't want to. These have a default had provide a simpler interface for users. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    I thought it was fun to add all my buildings. I didn't have time to play around with what the loop feature would look like to have users explore the map but I think that could be really fun to make a little game of it by adding more methods and so on. It took me a few tries to determine what overrides or overloads I would even want to add, but honestly just think of user needs and really look at the changes to the Building class to make sure that it will work with it.
